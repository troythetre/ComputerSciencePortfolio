An IOS app, aims to be a cultural hub for “the underground”, fostering creative and intellectual exchanges of thought among users and creators. The Archive IOS app promotes three main pillars, the “3 C’s”: creativity, community, and content. Archived understands the importance of creative material, notably music and clothing, so we provide a platform for creatives, regardless of size and popularity, to impact underground culture. The longevity of the underground is dependent upon community-building and social engagement; therefore our app provides an ideal space for individuals to find like-minded communities and exchange personal thoughts with the world. Artists and underground content do not typically reach traditional news organizations, so our app capitalizes on these underrepresented creatives via independent journalism, social media, and other non-traditional methods.
