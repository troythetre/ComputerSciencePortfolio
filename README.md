# Archive

An IOS app, aims to be a cultural hub for “the underground”, fostering creative and intellectual exchanges of thought among users and creators. The Archive IOS app promotes three main pillars, the “3 C’s”: creativity, community, and content. Archived understands the importance of creative material, notably music and clothing, so we provide a platform for creatives, regardless of size and popularity, to impact underground culture. The longevity of the underground is dependent upon community-building and social engagement; therefore our app provides an ideal space for individuals to find like-minded communities and exchange personal thoughts with the world. Artists and underground content do not typically reach traditional news organizations, so our app capitalizes on these underrepresented creatives via independent journalism, social media, and other non-traditional methods.

# Splitz Stream App

Empowering Artists and Content creators with a mobile app that utilizes blockchain technology for secure management, simplifying split sheets creation, copyright registration, music distribution, and payment collection.

# Stock Option Simulator 

I coded a stock option simulator in Python making use of numpy and MATLAB with the goal of developing an effective algorithm to analyze China's stock market and predict its future trends as accurately as possible.

# Phased-Locked Loop

As part of my IB extended essay, I developed a comprehensive analysis of nonlinear phase-locked loops using high-school calculus, going beyond the simplified linear analysis typically presented in university textbooks. I created a design procedure with optimal parameters to help novices build PLLs within specifications. This process was supported by a custom Python-based EDA tool I developed. The project was validated by constructing and testing a GPS local oscillator, demonstrating the effectiveness of the entire design chain.

# High School Varsity Basketball Statistics Analysis Website

As captain of the Varsity Basketball team of my high school, I created an analytic tool that collects season stats from gametape uploaded and displays the statistics in graphs to further allow coaches and players to reflect and improve their game. 

# Logistic Growth Model

I created an improved logistic growth model that can be employed as an approach to help ecologists improve population model. Population control is crucial to prevent from further overpopulation in the Third World. Essentially, our society needs an appropriate tool or model to accurately evaluate and estimate the effectiveness of any control plan. The
prevailing one is the logistic growth model. It must be constructive to the world if I could explore a way to enhance the estimation accuracy on this model or those inherited from it. Since China has the world's largest population (1.42 billion), followed by India (1.35 billion), they are my examples of exploration; we could also learn the effectiveness of their population control through the model.
